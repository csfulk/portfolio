# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Colt ‚Äî Design Systems Architect, Interface Optimist, and Recovering Pixel Addict

I once rebuilt the engine of a 1985 Toyota pickup with a borrowed wrench set and a lot of misplaced confidence. These days, I channel that same stubborn optimism into building scalable design systems with Figma, React, and just enough CSS variables to keep things interesting.

At YouTube, I led the design of the TV app interface ‚Äî work that helped make it Nielsen‚Äôs #1 app for viewtime. It wasn‚Äôt about flashy features; it was about building a system that could scale across devices, regions, and teams without falling apart under the weight of its own complexity. Design systems: glamorous stuff.

Later, in Zurich, I helped Google Europe break up with Sketch and transition to Figma. It was a clean break. I partnered with Figma directly, ran trainings across disciplines, and migrated libraries with enough care to make a Swiss train conductor proud.

These days, I‚Äôm focused on building a portfolio that reflects my approach: modular, expressive, slightly over-engineered (but in a good way). It features animated transitions, password-gated case studies, and a carefully managed sense of humor.

## üìÅ Case Study Viewer Architecture

### üñºÔ∏è FigmaEmbedViewer.jsx
`src/components/FigmaEmbedViewer.jsx` is a modular React component for displaying a Figma embed in a modal overlay. It supports:
- Fade-in animation on open
- Cropping of the Figma bottom bar for a clean look
- Always-visible close button (top right)
- Keyboard accessibility (Escape closes modal if iframe is not focused)

**Props:**
- `embedUrl` (string): The Figma embed URL to display
- `onClose` (function): Callback to close the modal

### üñºÔ∏è projectViewer.jsx (FeaturedProjectViewer)
`src/components/projectViewer.jsx` exports `FeaturedProjectViewer`, a React component for image gallery case studies. It supports:
- Image carousel with left/right navigation
- Keyboard navigation (‚Üê/‚Üí arrows, R to reset)
- Fade-in animation
- Always-visible close button
- Focus trap for accessibility

**Props:**
- `title` (string): Optional title for the gallery
- `images` (array): Array of image URLs to display
- `onClose` (function): Callback to close the modal

## ‚ûï Adding Case Study Buttons

All case study buttons are defined in `src/caseStudyButtons.js`.

**To add a new button:**
1. Find the section key (`youtube`, `apple`, `figma`, etc.) in `caseStudyButtons`.
2. Add a new object to the array with the following fields:
   - `text`: Button label
   - `icon`: Icon class (e.g., 'icon-Lock_light')
   - `action`: Viewer config object:
     - For Figma embeds: `{ type: 'FigmaEmbedViewer', embedUrl: 'YOUR_FIGMA_EMBED_URL' }`
     - For image galleries: `{ type: 'FeaturedProjectViewer', caseStudyKey: 'YOUR_CASE_STUDY_KEY' }`

**Example:**
```js
// In src/caseStudyButtons.js
caseStudyButtons.youtube.push({
  text: 'Case Study 4',
  icon: 'icon-Lock_light',
  action: {
    type: 'FigmaEmbedViewer',
    embedUrl: 'https://embed.figma.com/deck/your-new-url'
  }
});
```

**No need to update multiple files!** The UI will automatically use the new button.
