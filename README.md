# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Colt â€” Design Systems Architect, Interface Optimist, and Recovering Pixel Addict

I once rebuilt the engine of a 1985 Toyota pickup with a borrowed wrench set and a lot of misplaced confidence. These days, I channel that same stubborn optimism into building scalable design systems with Figma, React, and just enough CSS variables to keep things interesting.

At YouTube, I led the design of the TV app interface â€” work that helped make it Nielsenâ€™s #1 app for viewtime. It wasnâ€™t about flashy features; it was about building a system that could scale across devices, regions, and teams without falling apart under the weight of its own complexity. Design systems: glamorous stuff.

Later, in Zurich, I helped Google Europe break up with Sketch and transition to Figma. It was a clean break. I partnered with Figma directly, ran trainings across disciplines, and migrated libraries with enough care to make a Swiss train conductor proud.

These days, Iâ€™m focused on building a portfolio that reflects my approach: modular, expressive, slightly over-engineered (but in a good way). It features animated transitions, password-gated case studies, and a carefully managed sense of humor.
