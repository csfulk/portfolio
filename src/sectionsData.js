    description: `At YouTube, I grew from an independent contributor to a design lead, shaping product experiences used by billions. I led design across TV, web, mobile, tablet, and voice—bringing clarity and cohesion to a complex, fast-moving ecosystem.
One standout chapter was leading the Movies & Shows team, where I scaled design from a single storefront to five globally, helping grow subscriptions from 68 million to over 180 million. It was a mix of strategic thinking and hands-on design—aligning business goals with what people actually enjoy using.
In 2018, I also led the design system for YouTube on TV. That system still powers the experience today and helped make it the #1 rated streaming app on Nielsen.`,

    description: `At Apple, I led the visual systems for Developer Documentation and Publishing across iOS and macOS, managing a team of four designers in the creation of over 600 technical diagrams featured throughout Apple’s developer ecosystem. I developed and maintained a rigorous style guide and reusable pattern library, ensuring visual clarity and consistency across highly complex, widely-used documentation.
  In addition to documentation, I brought deep technical expertise in the Adobe Creative Suite to produce more than 1,500 pixel-perfect UI assets for Apple’s core software products—including iTunes, GarageBand, Keynote, Pages, and Safari. Each asset adhered to Apple’s exacting brand standards, supporting both internal development workflows and polished public-facing experiences at global scale.`,

    description: `Before Figma became the industry standard, Sketch was the go-to tool at companies like Google and YouTube. In 2020, as Figma gained traction, I spearheaded Google Europe’s transition to the platform—driving adoption from the ground up while based in Zurich. I worked directly with Figma’s team and partnered with senior leadership to craft a scalable rollout strategy. I led hands-on training across disciplines, aligning designers and engineers, and took point on migrating YouTube’s design libraries from Sketch to Figma—laying the foundation for a new era of collaborative design at scale.`,
